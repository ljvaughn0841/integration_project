# Lou Vaughn
# The purpose of this program is to assist decision making in groups

# originally this was supposed to be simple where i would just do the math bits for each part
# but i ended up trying to go ahead and so its bit of a mess that i couldnt finish
# selecting 1 person will just skip you to the end
# and for 2-8 people i ran into a some issues when you just add up scores and compare thus couldnt finish

'''
it said to add a coment explaining some operaters so here we go

for numeric operators
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
% modulus aka remainder from long division
** power or exponential
// floor division aka intiger division

for string operators
* duplicate or repeat
+ just puts them together no spaces

'''


'''
Main menu for selecting modes
Potential future modes are random, random weight?, weighted, 0?, and weighted 0.
0 would give the each player the ability to veto one option
Weighted modes would use mult instead of add to give higher numbers higher values.
